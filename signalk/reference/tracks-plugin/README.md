# @signalk/tracks and @signalk/tracks-plugin
This repo contains two npm modules:
- `@signalk/tracks` - RxJs based module that accumulates positions into a track, using a configured time resolution and retains a sliding window of points. Contains the code for both a Signal K server plugin that implements the track api and client side "TrackAccumulator" class that manages the track for a single vessel. TrackAccumulator can optionally bootstrap the track data from the server. The result is available as `Observable<LatLng[]>`.
- `@signalk/tracks-plugin` Convenience module that exposes the plugin part of `@signalk/tracks`.


# Tracks
Plugin for tracks accumulation and the track API


# Usage:

__Retrieve tracks for individual vessel:__

`/signalk/v1/api/tracks/<vesselId>`

---

__Retrieve tracks for all vessels:__

`/signalk/v1/api/tracks`

_If `maxRadius` is specified only vessels with last track position within this distance are returned._

---

__Retrieve tracks for all vessels within a given radius (in meters) from your vessel position:__

`/signalk/v1/api/tracks?radius=50000`

_Note: This value overrides the `maxRadius` value specified in plugin configuration._

---

__Retrieve tracks for all vessels within a bounded area:__

`/signalk/v1/api/tracks?bbox=130,-35,139,-33`

_Bounded area is defined as `lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2`_

_`lon1, lat1` = lower left corner of bounded area_

_`lon2, lat2` = upper right corner of bounded area_
